There are two ways a human can interact with Autonomous Goblin Paradise:
<br>1. observe the goblins' autonomous behavior
<br>2. mind-control the goblins


<p><br><u>Observer Controls</u>

<p>1. Realm observation

<p>The map in the background shows the approximately 1000 Shires generated at initialization.
The outer light-brown area is uninhabitable nothingness.  Inhabitable Shires contain four terrain plots that may
be brown, green, or blue depending on rainfall, and more or less mountainous depending on altitude.
Hover over a plot to see its number, its name, and its encompassing four terrain plots in red.
Click on the Shire to view it in the Shire observation panel.

<p>2.  Shire observation

<p>The off-yellow box on the right displays information about a Shire.  The five boxes in the middle can be clicked to
display different types of information.<ul>
<li>The flower-looking thing displays Shire resources and assets.  Right now it only shows what's in the Shire's Knowledge Library.
<li>The stick figure shows information on the Shire's inhabitants.
Click a goblin's name in red to view him/her in the Goblin observation panel.
<li>The M with a line through it shows market information, prices and orders for each tradeable good.
<li>The blank boxes will eventually show other info, for now they default to population info.</ul>

<p>3.  Goblin observation

<p>The off-yellow box on the left displays information about a goblin.
At the top under the name is an accurate visualization of the goblin's face.  Click for crude animation.
There are six boxes in the middle to click for subcategories of information.<ul>
<li>The "i" button shows basic info like name, location, job, liege, lover, and various assets and attributes.
<li>The eye displays the goblin's ideology, his/her weighing of different values.
<li>The star shows skills and prestige, most of these don't do anything yet.
<li>The yin-yang describes the goblin's behavioral traits.  Some of these are also not used yet.
<li>The flag shows quest information.  At the top is the quest stack, lower down is the GobLog (description of recent activity).
<li>The triangle is Order information.  This displays member goblins in descending rank order.</ul>

<p>4.  Time control

<p>The grey box in the middle is a general control panel.
Most of it is for avatar control, but it is also necessary for making time pass and stop.
Make sure you press "Autopilot off" first.  Then you can press "Play/Pause" to control time.

<p><br><u>Avatar Controls</u>

<p>The grey box in the middle can be used to manually interfere with the goblins' autonomy.
It is currently a major haven for bugs.  Using it will likely cause any goblins that interact with the avatar to behave abnormally.
<ul>
<li>Edit Avatar: Play with the look of your goblin's face. Changes not permanent.
<li>Possess Goblin: Unhappy with your avatar?  Find a goblin you like, select in goblin observation panel, then press this to change avatar.
<li>View Avatar: Click this to select your avatar in the goblin observation panel.
<li>New Quest: Add a quest of your choice to the stack. Beware of likely bugs.
<li>Pursue Quest: Manually act on the current quest.
<li>Autopilot On/Off: If it says "off" then it's currently on, and vice versa.  Click to change.
Autopilot means you won't be asked to make decisions for the avatar.
<li>Step once:  Make one turn pass.
<li>Play/pause:  Start time or stop it.  Buggy.
<li>View spawn:  Brings up hypothetical offspring of avatar and goblin selected in observation panel.  Click on offspring in the middle to randomly regenerate.
These offspring are not real goblins, just something to play with.</ul>
